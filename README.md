# Michael Brophy Photography

## milestone project 1

In this project i used one of my passions as inspiration to build a fictional website for my photography business.
although the images i have used are not my own you can see exactly how the layout would suit any photographer of any style.

I have used my time throughout the project using mostly my own coding and searching for fixes to any problems i ran into, any coding 
i have used that is not my own will be credited at the bottom of this page.
