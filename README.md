# Michael Brophy Photography

## milestone project 1

In this project i used one of my passions as inspiration to build a fictional website for my photography business.
although the images i have used are not my own you can see exactly how the layout would suit any photographer of any style.

I have used my time throughout the project using mostly my own coding and searching for fixes to any problems i ran into, any coding 
i have used that is not my own will be credited at the bottom of this page.

### UX

* USER STORIES
  *  As a user i would like to know more about the photographer i want to choose.
  *  As a user i want to find a photographer that has different packages to choose from.
  *  As a user i want to be able to see examples of previous work.
  *  As a user i want to see customer reviews.
  * As a returning user i have liked the style of photography and packages and want to book.

* DESIGN
  
    When designing this website i wanted to give it a feel of luxury, i decided to use the royal blue as my primary colour accompanied with a dark grey and #fafafa white for lettering, a lighter blue for button hover and 0, 0, 0, 0.2 over the body to give it a light grey colour. For the typography i have used the Jost font for headers with Roboto for the paragraphs with a font size of 16px and line spacing to 140% making all text easy to read. I have used some beautiful photographs throughout the website and have used the rule of thirds for the hero image. I wanted to make sure the user got to where they wanted as easily as possible, so adding buttons on the home page to the gallery and packages is a key feature. I have tried to make the website easy to navigate while getting straight to the point, A gallery for users to see previous work, three packages to choose from and a contact page. 

* WIRE FRAMES

    You can find wireframes in the assets folder.

### FEATURES

 * TESTING

   * USER STORY TESTING
     
     I have had a number of family members test the website for me, they have agreed that the website is a good representative of the user stories. 

   * FURTHER TESTING

     I have published the site on github pages and tested it on chrome, Microsoft edge, Firefox, internet explorer and safari. I have also ran tests on the code using w3c validater and have ran all text through a spell checker.

   * KNOW BUGS

      The bugs that i have come across are, internet explorer displays my website as a mobile device, i think this is down to internet explorer not being updated. the only other bug i have come across is the image slider doesn't work on mobile devices.
